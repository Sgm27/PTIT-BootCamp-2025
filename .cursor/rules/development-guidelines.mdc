description: Development guidelines for database, environment, and build processes

# Development Guidelines

## Database & Environment
- **Database is currently deployed** - Always remember this when making database-related changes
- **Always check [.env](mdc:.env) file** before making any configuration changes or when troubleshooting issues
- Verify environment variables are properly configured before running the application

## Build Process
- **Do NOT build Android app automatically** after coding completion
- The developer will handle Android builds manually
- Focus on code completion and testing, not build processes

## Workflow Reminders
1. Check `.env` file for current configuration
2. Consider database deployment status when making schema changes
3. Complete coding tasks without triggering Android builds
4. Let the developer handle manual build processes
