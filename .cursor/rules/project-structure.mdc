# Project Structure and Configuration Guide

This project consists of multiple components with specific configurations:

## Docker Compose Configuration
Always check the docker-compose files to understand the project setup:
- [backend/db/docker-compose.yml](mdc:backend/db/docker-compose.yml) - Database configuration

## Key Components

### Backend Server
The main backend entry point is [backend/run_server.py](mdc:backend/run_server.py) - this is the primary server file that should be referenced for backend operations.

### Android Application  
The Android app is located in the [backend/GeminiLiveDemo/](mdc:backend/GeminiLiveDemo/) folder. This contains the complete Android project structure with:
- Gradle build files
- Android app source code
- Configuration files

## Project Architecture
When analyzing this project, always:
1. Read the relevant docker-compose.yml files to understand service configurations
2. Reference run_server.py for backend logic and API endpoints
3. Look in backend/GeminiLiveDemo/ for Android app related code
4. Consider the multi-service architecture when making recommendations

## Folders to Ignore
- **backend/backend_aws/**: This folder is not currently in use and should be ignored when analyzing the project

This helps ensure you understand the full context of how services interact and are configured.
