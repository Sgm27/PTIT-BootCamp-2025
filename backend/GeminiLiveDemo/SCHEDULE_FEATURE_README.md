## Technical Implementation

### Backend
- FastAPI-based REST API
- PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Authentication middleware for secure access
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

### Android App
- Kotlin-based native Android application
- Retrofit for API communication
- Coroutines for asynchronous operations
- Material Design components for UI

### Security Features
- JWT token authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure API endpoints
- Data validation and sanitization

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
```

### Database Setup
```sql
-- Run the initialization script
\i db/init_scripts/01_init_database.sql
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Schedule
```json
POST /api/schedules
{
  "title": "Uá»‘ng thuá»‘c huyáº¿t Ã¡p",
  "message": "Uá»‘ng thuá»‘c theo chá»‰ Ä‘á»‹nh cá»§a bÃ¡c sÄ©",

GET /api/schedules?user_id=123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

## Testing

### API Testing
```bash
# Test family connection endpoints
python test_family_connection_api.py
```

### Android App Testing
1. Build and install the app
2. Login with test credentials
3. Navigate to Profile â†’ Káº¿t ná»‘i yÃªu thÆ°Æ¡ng
4. Test both elderly and family member flows

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication Errors**: Check JWT token validity
2. **Database Connection**: Verify PostgreSQL is running
3. **API Timeouts**: Check network connectivity
4. **Schedule Notifications**: Verify notification permissions

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in the Android app:
```kotlin
Log.d("FamilyConnection", "Debug message")
```
